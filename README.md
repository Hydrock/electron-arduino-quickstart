# Quickstart for Electron and Arduino
This repository is a quick-start for using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/), which is a great way to get started with hardware prototyping in JavaScript. it is loosely based on the [electron-quickstart](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) repository and follows a [tutorial](http://meow.noopkat.com/using-johnny-five-within-an-electron-app/) by @noopkat.

## Prerequisites
First, you have to install Firmata on your Arduino, which is a protocol to control microcontrollers. In the Arduino IDE, select the `Firmata Plus` sketch from the examples and upload it to your board.
Be sure to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed as well.

## How to use
First, hook up your Arduino with Firmata loaded on to it.
Next, clone this repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leoweigand/electron-arduino-quickstart.git
npm install
```
Use `npm start` to run your app and you are ready to go!

## Whatâ€™s next?
I recommend looking into the documentations of Johnny-Five and Electron for more information on the topic.

## Why is this useful?
If you want to program Arduino using JavaScript, Johnny-Five and node.js are a great way to start. But even for the most basic UI, you have to incorporate some sort of communication, for example using websockets with socket.io which is absolute overkill when it comes to prototyping. Using Electron on the other hand, we are able to use jQuery and other libraries and directly speak to Arduinos when actions occur in the browser window.
Unfortunately, there are some difficulties to overcome using Electron and the `serialport` library which might be confusing for beginners. As outlined in the tutorial by @noopkat, this fixes these problems and provides the boilerplate code for getting started with prototyping.
